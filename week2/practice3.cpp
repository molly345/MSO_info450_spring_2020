//Write a program that continually accepts a year value from a user and determines if it is a leap year.

//The year can be evenly divided by 4
//If the year can be divided by 100 it is NOT a leap year, unless
//The year is also evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
//2000 and 2400 are leap years
//1800 and 1900 are not leap years
